Hey there! 👋

I'm Matthew Sbar, a Senior Software Engineer. I'm a React front-end enthusiast with a versatile background in full-stack development. Professionally, my background is in web product marketing & ecommerce - that includes both SaaS and phyisical goods, B2B and B2C, web stores and product information management systems. Indepdendently, I've developed and shipped a handful of well-loved, widely-used web apps that helped manage the complexity of different online games.


**I'm currently working on the following:**

- 🔡 RuneWords, a game that combines Scrabble with RPG and TCG elements. Backend written in Rust and a client built in Godot.

**Some of my retired projects:**

- 🐭 [TemTrader](https://temtrader.back4app.io/), a trading platform for the MMO TemTem, when the game had no effective way of listing or searching for items to trade. This site has an awesome "screenshot autofill" feature that allowed users to transcribe a ton of information from their game client to their browser using OCR via Tesseract.js. Users could create advanced queries and create "live searches" so they could be notified in real-time about listings meeting their criterion. In its heyday, it was one of the most prominent community tools.

- 🔫 [The Cycle: Frontier - Item Tracker](https://matthewsbar.github.io/cycle-frontier-item-tracker/), a utility for the extraction shooter The Cycle: Frontier to help users manage their collection of items. In its heyday, it was used by nearly 20% of the game's playerbase.

- 🐱 [Matryoshka Simulator](https://matthewsbar.github.io/matryoshka-simulator/), a quick/fun item generation tool for the action RPG Path of Exile which simulates earning a reward which has a high degree of randomness.

- ☑️ Lost Ark Checklist Generator, a tool that allows the creation of daily and weekly task lists for the MMO Lost Ark that would dynamically adjust depending on an individual's account progression. Unfortunately the repository and website have been lost to time, but it was a great tool.

- 🛴 Looter Scooter, a very silly looter-shooter built in Unreal Engine 5 with an AWS backend. It had a working account system, an item generating system that was on par with the depth and complexity of a game like Path of Exile, and a variety of movement mechanics including wall-running, rail-grinding, sliding, gliding, and of course a grappling hook. This is on hiatus.
